							<br>
							Any Dispute arising out of or related to these Terms is personal to you and Company and will be resolved solely through individual arbitration and will not be brought as a class arbitration, class action or any other type of representative proceeding.

							<br><br><br>
							<b>20. NOTICE; INFORMAL DISPUTE RESOLUTION</b>

							<br><br>
							<b>AUTHORITY OF ARBITRATOR</b>

							As limited by these Terms, The arbitrator will have (i) the exclusive authority and jurisdiction to make all procedural and substantive decisions regarding a Dispute, including the determination of whether a Dispute is arbitrable, and (ii) the authority to grant any remedy that would otherwise be available in court; provided, however, that the arbitrator does not have the authority to conduct a class arbitration or a representative action, which is prohibited by these Terms.

							<br><br>
							<b>SEVERABILITY OF DISPUTE RESOLUTION & ARBITRATION PROVISIONS</b>

							<br><br>
							If any provision of these Terms is held by a court or other tribunal of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable for any reason, such provision shall be eliminated or limited to the minimum extent such that the remaining provisions of the Terms will continue in full force and effect.
							<br><br><br>
