							<br>
							Any Dispute arising out of or related to these Terms is personal to you and Company and will be resolved solely through individual arbitration and will not be brought as a class arbitration, class action or any other type of representative proceeding.

							<br><br><br>
							<b>20. NOTICE; INFORMAL DISPUTE RESOLUTION</b>
							<br>
							Each party will notify the other party in writing of any Dispute within thirty (30) days of the date it arises, so that the Parties can attempt in good faith to resolve the Dispute informally.

							Any arbitration will occur in the Seychelles. Arbitration will be conducted confidentially by a single arbitrator.
							<br><br>
							<b>AUTHORITY OF ARBITRATOR</b>
							<br>
							As limited by these Terms, The arbitrator will have (i) the exclusive authority and jurisdiction to make all procedural and substantive decisions regarding a Dispute, including the determination of whether a Dispute is arbitrable, and (ii) the authority to grant any remedy that would otherwise be available in court; provided, however, that the arbitrator does not have the authority to conduct a class arbitration or a representative action, which is prohibited by these Terms. The arbitrator may only conduct an individual arbitration and may not consolidate more than one individual’s claims, preside over any type of class or representative proceeding or preside over any proceeding involving more than one individual.
							<br><br>
							<b>SEVERABILITY OF DISPUTE RESOLUTION & ARBITRATION PROVISIONS</b>

							No waiver of by the Company of any Term or Condition set forth in these Terms  shall be deemed a further or continuing waiver of such Term or Condition or a waiver of any other Term or Condition, and any failure of the Company to assert a right or provision under these Terms  shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision.
							<br><br>
							If any provision of these Terms is held by a court or other tribunal of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable for any reason, such provision shall be eliminated or limited to the minimum extent such that the remaining provisions of the Terms will continue in full force and effect.
							<br><br><br>
