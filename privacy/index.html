							<h3 class="name">Privacy Policy</h3>
							<p class="text-right">Last updated: May 27, 2018</p>
							<p>webRunes Limited (in incorporation) (the "<b>Company</b>", "<b>we</b>" or "<b>us</b>") respect the privacy of our Users (each, "<b>you</b>" or "<b>User</b>") and are committed to protect the privacy of Users who access, download, install or register to <a href="https://wr.io">wr.io</a> (the "<b>Website</b>"); any Company social media channels; or WRIO Internet OS browser (the "<b>Platform</b>"), (collectively, the "<b>Services</b>"). The Company has papered this Privacy Policy to outline our practices with respect to collecting, using and disclosing your information when you use the Services. We encourage you to read the Privacy Policy carefully and use it to make informed decisions. By using the Services, you agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy and your continued use of the Services constitutes your ongoing agreement to the Privacy Policy. The Privacy Policy is a part of the <a href="https://wr.io/terms">Terms of Use</a>. In this Privacy Policy you will read about, among other things:
							<ul class="disc">
								<li>What type of information we collect.</li>
								<li>Cookies and Google Analytics.</li>
								<li>How we use the information.</li>
								<li>With whom we share the information and for what purpose.</li>
								<li>For how long we retain the information.</li>
								<li>How we protect your information.</li>
								<li>Advertisements.</li>
								<li>Advertising ID and Advertising Identifier.</li>
								<li>How to contact us.</li>
							</ul>
							<br><br>
							<b>1. TYPES OF INFORMATION WE COLLECT</b>
							<br>
							We may collect two types of data and information from our Users. The first type of information is un-identified and non-identifiable information pertaining to you, which may be made available or gathered via your use of the Services ("<b>Non-Personal Data</b>"). We are not aware of the identity from which the Non-Personal Data is collected. Non-Personal Data which is collected may include your aggregated usage information and technical information transmitted by your device, including certain software and hardware information about your device (e.g., the device you use, the type of browser and operating system your device uses, language preference, access time and the website’s domain name from which you linked to the Services, etc.), in order to enhance the functionality of the Services. We may also collect information about your activity on the Services (e.g., pages viewed, online browsing, clicks, actions, timestamps, etc.). The second type of information is individually identifiable information, namely information that identifies an individual or may with reasonable effort identify an individual ("<b>Personal Information</b>").
							<ul class="alpha">
								<li><b>Non-Personal Data:</b> Non-Personal Data is information that does not identify you specifically, including data collected automatically when you enter the Services. This may include cookies, pixel tags, web beacons, browser analysis tools, and web server logs. This also includes information from the devices you use to access Our Services, your operating system type or mobile device model, browser type, domain, and other system settings, as well as the language your system uses and the country and time zone of your device. Our server logs may also record the IP addresses of the devices you use to interact with the Services. We may also collect information about a website you were visiting before you came to the Services and any website you visit after you leave the Services, if this information is supplied to Us by your browser. We may also use software tools, such as JavaScript, to measure and collect session information, including page response times, download errors, and methods used to browse away from the page. Non-Personal Data also includes some data collected by location services.</li>
								<li><b>Personal Information:</b> Such information may include:
								<br>
								1. <b>Account Information:</b> When you sign-up and register to the Services, you will be asked to provide us certain details about yourself.
								<br>
								2. <b>Registering Through Our Website:</b> When you register to the Services through our Website, we may collect from you the following information: full name, email address, home address, hometown, nationality, birthdate, phone number, as well as information required for our compliance with regulatory Know Your Customer ("<b>KYC</b>") and Anti-Money Laundering ("<b>AML</b>") requirements, such as passport or other identification number, and any other information you agreed to share with us.
								<br>
								3. <b>Voluntarily Information:</b> We may collect information which you provide us voluntarily. For instance, when you respond to communications from us, communicate with us via email or share additional information about yourself through your use of the Services. We may also collect the feedback, suggestions, complaints and reports which you send to us.
								<br>
								4. <b>Device Information:</b> We may collect Personal Information from your device. Such information may include geolocation data, IP address, unique identifiers (e.g., MAC address and UUID) as well as other information which relates to your activity through the Services.
								</li>
							</ul>
							<br>
							For the avoidance of doubt, if we combine Personal Information with Non-Personal Data, the combined information will be treated as Personal Information as long as it remains combined.
							<br><br>
							<b>2. YOUR CONSENT</b>
							<br>
							<ul class="alpha">
								<li>By using the Services, you are consenting to the Company collecting, using and disclosing your Personal Information in accordance with this Privacy Policy. If you do not agree to the collection, use and disclosure of your Personal Information in this way, please do not use the Services or otherwise provide the Company with your Personal Information.</li>
								<li>The Company will only collect, use or disclose your Personal Information where it is fair and lawful to do so. In most cases, We will ask for your consent explicitly but, in some cases, We may infer consent from your actions and behaviour. We may ask you to provide additional consent if We need to use your Personal Information for purposes not covered by this Privacy Policy. You are not obliged to provide such consent but if you decide not to then your participation in certain activities may be restricted. If you provide additional consent, the Terms of that consent shall prevail in the event of any conflict with the terms of this Privacy Policy.</li>
								<li>Please note, however, that We may process your Personal Information without consent if we have a legitimate reason to do so, provided that such use will not have a prejudicial effect on your own rights, freedoms and interests.</li>
							</ul>
							<br><br>
							<b>3. COOKIES</b>
							<br>
							We may use cookies and other technologies or methods of web and mobile analysis (e.g., pixels, FullStory, Google Analytics, etc.) to gather, store, and track certain information related with your access to and activity through the Services, including when you visit our Website or use our Platform. A cookie is a string of information that a website stores on a visitor’s computer, and that the visitor’s browser provides to the website each time the visitor returns. Cookies are very helpful and may be used for various different purposes. These purposes include, among other things, allowing you to navigate between pages efficiently, enabling automatic activation of certain features, remembering your preferences and making the interaction between you and the Services quicker, easier and smoother. Our Website and Platform may use the following types of cookies:
							<ul class="alpha">
								<li>Session Cookies which are stored only temporarily during a browsing session in order to allow normal use of the system and are deleted from your device when the browser is closed.</li>
								<li>Persistent Cookies which are saved on your device for a fixed period and are not deleted when the browser is closed. Such cookies are used where we need to identify who you are for repeated visits (for instance, to allow us to store your preferences for the next sign-in).</li>
								<li>Third-Party Cookies which are set by other online services that run content on the page you view on your browser (for example, by third-party advertising companies who monitor and analyze our Website access).</li>
							</ul>
							<br>
							You may remove the cookies by following the instructions of your device preferences. However, if you choose to disable cookies, some features of the Services may not operate properly and your online experience may be limited.
							<br><br>
							We may also use a tool called Google Analytics to collect information about your use of the Services. Google Analytics collects information such as how often Users access the Services, what pages they visit when they do so, etc. We use the information we get from Google Analytics only to improve our Services. Google Analytics collects the IP address assigned to you on the date you visit sites, rather than your name or other identifying information. We do not combine the information collected through the use of Google Analytics with personally identifiable information. Google’s ability to use and share information collected by Google Analytics about your visits to this site is restricted by the <a href="https://www.google.com/analytics/terms/us.html" target="_blank">Google Analytics Terms of Service</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup><i class="fa fa-window-maximize"></i></sup></i> and the <a href="https://www.google.com/policies/privacy/" target="_blank">Google Privacy Policy</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup><i class="fa fa-window-maximize"></i></sup></i>.
							<br><br>
							<b>4. USE OF PERSONAL INFORMATION & NON-PERSONAL DATA</b>
							<br>
							We use and share Personal Information and Non-Personal Data in the manners described in this Privacy Policy. In addition to the purposes listed above, the information we collect, which may include your Personal Information, is used for the following purposes:
							<ul class="alpha">
