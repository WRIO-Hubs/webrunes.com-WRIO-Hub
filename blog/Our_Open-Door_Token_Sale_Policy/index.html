          "about": "We are doing something that could change the way ICOs are run in the future. We want to give people freedom to support our project if they believe in it, but also give them the chance to back out at any time they are not happy. So our ICO is going to run a little differently to what you are used to. But we think you’ll like it!",
          "articleBody": [
           "Vitalik Buterin has talked about DAICOs being the future, and how they can help protect your money if a project fails to deliver, but DAICOs require the whole community to vote together to pull out of a project. So if only a few people want their ETH back, they have no way of doing so. This is why we are taking the concept to the next level:",

           "100% of the ETH raised in our token sale will be held in a buyback fund, and you will be able to buy ETH back any time after the soft cap is reached. The earlier you buy in to the token sale, the more bonus you get, and each time someone sells WGD back to the smart contract, it is burned. There is no need to vote to return all funds as you would in a DAICO. Simply buy your ETH back and move on.",

           "Because of this fluid nature, the sale will remain open until the hard cap is reached. The usual issues around locking up a users investment for months do not apply here. Your tokens can be traded back for ETH any time after the soft cap is reached. You will also have plenty of opportunity to track the progress of the team, and can buy more WGD in subsequent stages as you choose.",

           "Once the soft cap is met, you can swap your tokens back for ETH any time at an exchange rate calculated by the formula in the diagram below this article. When the hard cap is reached, no more WGD will be created, and all WGD sent to the buyback fund will be burned. So each time someone sends WGD back, the amount of ETH decreases, and the WGD supply also decreases. Each time someone buys WGD, more ETH is added to the fund backing our token.",

           "Stage 2 — Medium bonus, soft-cap is hit, the buyback fund is opened",
           "Stage 3 — Small bonus, Bancor protocol is activated for improved liquidity",
