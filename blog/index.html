So our ICO is going to run a little differently to what you are used to. But we think you’ll like it!",

We don’t have a technology problem, we have a social problem. The problem is not Google, or Amazon, or Facebook. The problem is that online users follow winner-take-all distribution. Is a structural distribution independent from the type of service. Making a new service will not change that.",

At the moment we are a small team, but we harbor a great desire to change this world for the better or at least a little bit.",
