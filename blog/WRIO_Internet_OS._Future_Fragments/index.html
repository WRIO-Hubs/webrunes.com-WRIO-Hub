        "about": "To better describe our vision for the future of the Internet, we are publishing a series of science fiction shorts that describe various challenges associated with the current state of the Internet, and our vision of how to solve them. These stories will be followed by previews of projects mentioned throughout the narrative. Keep in mind: some of these ideas may change, some may not, and others will remain a fantasy. At the moment we are a small team, but we harbor a great desire to change this world for the better or at least a little bit.",

        "Victor had just arrived home, a young man in an excellent mood  – he scored another rarity for his now very hard to find CD-collection. Gently taking a small, slim, and transparent plastic box with a logo of a now non-existent company out of the package, he curiously turned it over in his hands. Filled with excitement, he delicately opened it and walked to a brightly lit window to closely inspect its contents. As the sunbeams reached his hands, his eyes fell upon the mystically looking circular object. The disc was labeled with strange text reading: “CD-R 650 MB”, Gently pushing his thumb on the raised plastic center, Victor removed the disc from the case with a slight click. As Victor turned towards the window and slightly rotated the object into direct sunlight, its reflection projected a scattered multicolored light across the room creating an otherworldly aura.",
        "“You got it!” Victor’s younger brother, Karl, exclaimed as he clumsily crashed into the room running towards the object. Victor rapidly turned away from Karl to protect the disc. “Give it to me! Let me see it!” screeched Karl, as he snatched the bright item out of his brother’s hands while paying no attention to Victor’s discontent with his reckless handling of the rarity, quickly raising the disc closer to his eyes and grumbling.. “Err… It’s only 650 Mb?”. Victor quickly responded with disdain. “Well, they didn’t really save on physical space in the past, if they wrote all of their data on such large size media with such small capacity. Just imagine how many of these will be required to record at least one holographic movie!”",
        "Victor chuckled but refrained from lecturing his brother once again about the historical formatting and their monopoly on space. Instead he sat in front of his glowing heads-up-display, entered a password on its surface, and opened his WRIO Internet OS profile page. Few in the past would use such a term, let alone have access to this technology. However, now WRIO Internet OS provided a unified entry point allowing access to all users, while camouflaging identities. It was called a “semantic network” or simply “network”. Victor recalled reading that not so long ago the network was divided into separate fragments called “websites” and users were required to know the addresses of these “websites” in order to access them. Special services called “search engines” were a popular feature in the past for locating these “websites” if the address was unknown. While he attempted to commit the name of one such service to memory, its peculiar name escaped his mind.",
        "New projects to innovate on these nascent technologies eventually emerged. Their authors approached the problem of the user seeking out content, and sought out a way to flip the equation. They transformed the core of the technology – now information was looking for the user, and not the other way around. While still young and a new developer, Victor’s more experienced workmates told him tales of the past. They shared stories of when developers had to think about such things like  separate design and User Interface (UI) for every single website. On the other end, Victor lamented at the thought of users struggling to figure out what they were looking for, where it was located, and also consume content completely controlled by the resource owner. On top of that, users involuntarily endured unnecessary elements of the forced UI. At the same time developers had to face the insidious beast of cross-browser compatibility! Victor did not fully understand or empathize with the problem, but the despair and expressions of grief associated with these recounts of the past provided a picture of the immensity of the issue. Then phrases like “so that it would be displayed smoothly on the whole, '$#@!', zoo of devices!” brought to his imagination terrible monsters that web-developers fought against, much like knights in glittering armor.",
        "While he was unfamiliar with the term “caching”, he knew that in the past, the connection was slow and websites required the user to unwittingly download junk in order to correctly display each individual website. However, he tried to remain objective and not believe every story he was told; it often seemed to him that superiors simply pulled his leg and laughed behind his back. They even recounted tales of virtual attacks and war, commonly referred to with dreadful words, such as DDoS, CNE, CNA or XSS. He imagined virtual ancient pirate-like battles, but fought on the forefront of virtual battlegrounds. It was probably because the word “pirates” was also commonly associated with these attacks. Later he began to ask more detailed questions about the subject. And even if this was true, many such attacks couldn’t happen today as the system simply receives data textually (JSON-LD) and then subsequently sends it in a similar manner. Thus by default, data cannot harm either the client or server when shared this way. Furthermore, this approach enables instant sending of incremental, small kilobyte pages as the client or server receives only useful data without any unnecessary HTML, JS and CSS junk.",
        "He also knew that earlier web pages were detached from the global semantic data pool. The search engines that came to mind earlier, to a very limited extent, solved this task. Victor frequently used colorful analogies to help him understand technology of the past. He imagined the search engines as giants with clay feet. Millions bowed down to these search engine giants to beg for the network location of their desired information. Victor trembled at the thought of the consequences of incorrectly asking the search engines for network locations! He also heard blood-curdling stories about spam and non-relevant advertisements. The rumor said that these demons lurked on practically every website. Victor found it rather useful that now the network offered custom ads at the appropriate moment based on his preferences and requirements. Authors of articles, books, music, and video, manufacturers of various products – all of them had to participate in the insane rush for consumers. An incredible amount of money was spent for ads, which increased prices, not to mention that the ads were almost never objective and simply deceived consumers, or at best embellished the goods. Websites were unable to distinguish users and knew nothing about their interest. He could never wrap his head around the logic behind distributing the same canned ads to every audience and user segment.",
        "Once again Victor felt sorry for the users. He pictured them as unfortunate, small woodland creatures wandering in a huge, tangled labyrinth, trying to force their way to the required information through the wilderness of ads and spam that grew in abundance as enormous, monstrous  trees tangling users with their meandering  branches. If users managed to avoid the malevolent spam forest, it was too early to rejoice: one must continue to stay alert, as to avoid the relentless sinkholes of fraudulent, deceptive websites hidden throughout the network. While a current day savior, the “Trust Level” concept (a distributed universal reputation tool) was not used at that time to hunt and destroy fakes and spam once and for all.",
        "To add to the already hazardous environment, social networks acted as a carnival of deceit and misery. Many users disregarded warnings about the risk of providing personal data to these connected social networks. Victor just shuttered in disbelief and disgust when hearing about such networks. Now every user possesses an individual reliable blockchain-based store that securely safeguards the owner’s data. While the theft of personal data has always been severely punished, Victor was astonished at the thought users would willingly relinquish their personal data to complete strangers. Victor could not come to terms with this former reality, so he comforted himself by telling himself these were the tall tales and exaggerated stories of senior colleagues. The only fact he knew to be true was that all user data was saved not on p2p-WRIOOS-servers, but locally or on discs like the one he held in this hands – a piece of the past glistening in the eternal sun!"
