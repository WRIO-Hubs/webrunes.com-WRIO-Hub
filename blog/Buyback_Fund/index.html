        "There is a problem in the ICO space today. Most ICOs are either scams, or like most crowdfunded projects, fail to deliver on their promises. Users are forced to place a lot of trust in the team, and once they contribute their hard-earned ETH there is nothing they can do if the project goes off the rails. ICO participants are stuck holding useless tokens or waiting months to be able to convert their tokens back at a fraction of the ICO price.",
        "  ‎⁪⁭‏​‎⁪⁭‎⁪⁭​‎⁪‪​‎⁪‪​‎⁪‪​​​‎​‎​‎⁪​‎⁪​‎⁪⁭‏",
        "We have a solution. The way we are using the funds raised in our token sale will reduce risk while also increasing support for the platform. This new way of running an ICO will ensure guaranteed liquidity, price and long term value by only using contributed funds to grow the platform in meaningful ways.",
        "  ‎⁪⁭‏​‎⁪⁭‎⁪⁭​‎⁪‪​‎⁪‪​‎⁪‪​​​‎​‎​‎⁪​‎⁪​‎⁪⁭‏",
        "This is done using two key elements:",
        "  ‎⁪⁭‏​‎⁪⁭‎⁪⁭​‎⁪‪​‎⁪‪​‎⁪‪​​​‎​‎​‎⁪​‎⁪​‎⁪⁭‏",
        "1. All funds raised in the ICO will be used as an asset to back the new tokens value. Giving them tangible value from day one. This will have a self-regulating and stabilizing effect on the token economy much like the gold standard that backed the US dollar for many years.",
        "  ‎⁪⁭‏​‎⁪⁭‎⁪⁭​‎⁪‪​‎⁪‪​‎⁪‪​​​‎​‎​‎⁪​‎⁪​‎⁪⁭‏",
        "2. The funds will be held in an autonomous buyback fund. It is a completely self-regulated smart-contract, not controlled by anyone. There will be no fees and no profit for the company when users sell tokens to the fund. This means you can trade your tokens back for ETH whenever you want. The buyback fund will maintain a price defined by a simple mathematical calculation relating to the amount of ETH and number of tokens in the fund. You’ll never have to risk your whole investment.",
        "  ‎⁪⁭‏​‎⁪⁭‎⁪⁭​‎⁪‪​‎⁪‪​‎⁪‪​​​‎​‎​‎⁪​‎⁪​‎⁪⁭‏",

        "  ‎⁪⁭‏​‎⁪⁭‎⁪⁭​‎⁪‪​‎⁪‪​‎⁪‪​​​‎​‎​‎⁪​‎⁪​‎⁪⁭‏",
        "2. Volatility is greatly reduced as the token is highly correlated with ETH.",
        "  ‎⁪⁭‏​‎⁪⁭‎⁪⁭​‎⁪‪​‎⁪‪​‎⁪‪​​​‎​‎​‎⁪​‎⁪​‎⁪⁭‏",
        "3. Pump ‘n’ dump schemes are significantly harder, as there is a defined price at all times in the fund. So nobody will buy tokens at the pumped price.",
        "  ‎⁪⁭‏​‎⁪⁭‎⁪⁭​‎⁪‪​‎⁪‪​‎⁪‪​​​‎​‎​‎⁪​‎⁪​‎⁪⁭‏",
        "4. Just as the gold standard allowed anyone holding fiat to exchange it for gold bullion whenever they wanted, our upcoming ICO will allow users to exchange tokens for Ether in the same way.",
        "  ‎⁪⁭‏​‎⁪⁭‎⁪⁭​‎⁪‪​‎⁪‪​‎⁪‪​​​‎​‎​‎⁪​‎⁪​‎⁪⁭‏",
        "5. The platform will have a solid base to leverage as it gains popularity. Over time as users add value via apps, content and DAOs on the platform, it will start acting much like the economy of a growing country: increasing in value and providing a return for all users.",
        "  ‎⁪⁭‏​‎⁪⁭‎⁪⁭​‎⁪‪​‎⁪‪​‎⁪‪​​​‎​‎​‎⁪​‎⁪​‎⁪⁭‏",
        "This is the high level view of our token structure and its benefits. There are several other functions that ensure the economy runs in a stable and sustainable way, and we will expand on these in future posts.",
        "  ‎⁪⁭‏​‎⁪⁭‎⁪⁭​‎⁪‪​‎⁪‪​‎⁪‪​​​‎​‎​‎⁪​‎⁪​‎⁪⁭‏",
        "In a world where volatility destroys investments, tokens are launched with no inherent value, and your hard-earned money can be tied up in a token for months regardless of how the platform performs, we are working to usher in a new era of value and transparency.
