           "The 2001 Scientific American article by Berners-Lee, Hendler, and Lassila described an expected evolution of the existing web to a Semantic Web. In 2006, Berners-Lee and colleagues stated that: 'This simple idea…remains largely unrealized'. In 2013, more than four million web domains contained Semantic Web markup and that becomes the new trend",

Mobile phones and tablets will be followed by new thin client terminal devices with a browser-driven OSs that will have just a screen and Internet access. Each user's software agent will learn more about its respective user by electronically monitoring his or her activities. The balance between individual privacy and the benefit of having a personalized web browsing experience can be established by only the individual’s possessing the key to personal data encrypted in the blockchain. Access to the data will be provided to trusted applications in one click. They will obtain data, process them and transfer to the user.",

Such systems will be able to translate the meaning, rather than just words. Also programming will come to a new level. It will resemble communication with a machine with describing the desired result. Looking even further, such technical background may become the basis for a strong AI, and may be applied in Nano-Biological Computing that may appear within the next decade. We will witness the birth of new smart assistants significantly surpassing current poor systems like Siri.",

In response to a search query, instead of pages of links, such a system can return a custom-built page derived from various data sources and formatted based on that specific request.

The implementation of the project will result in a status quo where users will not need a desktop OS and will give rise to a new market of very inexpensive ​thin client terminal devices with a browser-driven WRIO Internet OS onboard and Web 3.0 apps responsible for various functions.",

            "Personal data, encrypted and stored on the blockchain, will enable a decentralized profile that is totally secure. No need to create separate accounts for every service you visit. Web 3.0 predictive apps will make new functions available with the click of a button, just like mobile applications do, but without having to install, setup or update. Everything will be done on remote servers, users will experience the results without needing to control the processing power. This approach opens a market of inexpensive and affordable terminal single-board computers with minimum requirements, only needing enough to launch a browser-driven OS. These efficient devices will create mesh-networks through Wi-Fi, allowing IoT ad hoc networks. Coupled with the tiny size of Web 3.0 pages it will be possible to transfer encrypted torrent-like packets that hop from one device to another until eventually reaching their destination without the need of a mobile phone operator or Internet service provider. This will result in a decentralized, block and censor-proof peer-to-peer Internet that will make the web truly global and free.",
