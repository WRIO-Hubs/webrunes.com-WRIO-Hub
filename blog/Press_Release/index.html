 "about": "",
 "articleBody": [
  "The webRunes team of crypto-punks announces the web upgrade project to build a machine-readable (semantic) web. The platform comprises of a number of approaches that enable a new level of browsing experience based on three key elements:",
  "1. Secure machine-readable format",
  "Data format JSON-LD (a set of Linked Data represented by a key-value pair) has been developed by Google, Microsoft, Yahoo and Yandex (more at http://schema.org). The format of pages is machine-readable, which allows the machines to “understand” the information contained in documents, thus enables automatic data processing. Automatic processing of data will pave the way for a secure user-centric Web 3.0, where users receive filtered information automatically based on their interests.",
  "The semantic format of pages is a text that contains only pure data, making it possible to create virus-free websites of a new generation. Such websites segregate contents (information) from representation (page markup, javascript, cascading style sheets), thus enabling websites to share each other’s data without any API. So, every new page, regardless of its original location, becomes an element of the public decentralized “wikipedia” of machine-readable data. These elements are like lego-bricks that anyone can use to create pages using information from the original source that always remain updated without any copy/paste.",
  "2. blockchain",
  "Blockchain functions as the database for the metadata of Web 3.0 pages, as well as a repository of user assets. The blockchain address serves as a universal privacy-respectful user ID, while cryptokeys serve as reliable passwords, thus providing a secure and convenient substitute to obsolete email+password combination.",
  "3. dApps",
  "A set of blockchain-powered unstoppable applications provide processing of Web 3.0 websites and customized rich functionality for users’ operations."

   "articleBody": [
    "WRIO Internet OS is a platform for the development of Web 3.0 that brings together all its elements. As a result we have a set of applications that use blockchain to store user profiles and pages metadata used in search queries with automatic processing, which become possible due to their machine-readable format.",
    "United elements produce the synergy effect and bring the browsing experience to a new secure user-centric level."

   "name": "Conclusion. New Frontier",
   "articleBody": [
    "We are rushing into the era of Internet of Things and Big Data where automated processing of data will be imperative for any new product or service. Following this new era will be the emergence of user-centric services and predictive search systems, that will soon replace traditional Web 2.0 services and become the new web standard.",
    "WRIO Internet OS will become the platform that serves as the launching pad for Web 3.0 products and applications, and will create a new market of browser-driven smart predictive systems — very inexpensive thin-client terminal devices with WRIO Internet OS onboard.",
    "Such devices will be able to automatically incorporate a global, fully distributed, and blockchain-powered peer-to-peer network serves as the trigger of new “unicorn” arrivals that will replace many of the visionary technology projects of the past.",
    "We will see Web 3.0 versions of Google, Skype, eBay, PayPal, Facebook, Uber, etc., using a single distributed source of machine-readable data pool. Borders of websites and domains that divide nowadays web will dissolve, and we will witness the advent of the P2P web: a network of interrelated peers powered by WRIO Internet OS that can exchange information without any restrictions, while respecting privacy at the same time.",
    "All principle components are described in the presentation. Those wishing to gain a thorough insight into all aspects can find answers in a solid White Paper.",
    "Register for the token sale scheduled for July 31!",
    "Have questions? Contact us on webRunes Telegram group. "
