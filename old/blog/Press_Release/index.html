  "The webRunes team of crypto-punks announces the web upgrade project to build a machine-readable (semantic) web. The platform comprises of a number of approaches that enable a new level of browsing experience based on three key elements:",
  "  ‎⁪⁭‏​‎⁪⁭‎⁪⁭​‎⁪‪​‎⁪‪​‎⁪‪​​​‎​‎​‎⁪​‎⁪​‎⁪⁭‏",
  "1. Secure machine-readable format",
  "Data format JSON-LD (a set of Linked Data represented by a key-value pair) has been developed by Google, Microsoft, Yahoo and Yandex (more at http://schema.org). The format of pages is machine-readable, which allows the machines to “understand” the information contained in documents, thus enables automatic data processing. Automatic processing of data will pave the way for a secure user-centric Web 3.0, where users receive filtered information automatically based on their interests.",
  "  ‎⁪⁭‏​‎⁪⁭‎⁪⁭​‎⁪‪​‎⁪‪​‎⁪‪​​​‎​‎​‎⁪​‎⁪​‎⁪⁭‏",
  "The semantic format of pages is a text that contains only pure data, making it possible to create virus-free websites of a new generation. Such websites segregate contents (information) from representation (page markup, javascript, cascading style sheets), thus enabling websites to share each other’s data without any API. So, every new page, regardless of its original location, becomes an element of the public decentralized “wikipedia” of machine-readable data. These elements are like lego-bricks that anyone can use to create pages using information from the original source that always remain updated without any copy/paste.",
  "  ‎⁪⁭‏​‎⁪⁭‎⁪⁭​‎⁪‪​‎⁪‪​‎⁪‪​​​‎​‎​‎⁪​‎⁪​‎⁪⁭‏",
  "2. blockchain",
  "Blockchain functions as the database for the metadata of Web 3.0 pages, as well as a repository of user assets. The blockchain address serves as a universal privacy-respectful user ID, while cryptokeys serve as reliable passwords, thus providing a secure and convenient substitute to obsolete email+password combination.",

As a result we have a set of applications that use blockchain to store user profiles and pages metadata used in search queries with automatic processing, which become possible due to their machine-readable format.",
